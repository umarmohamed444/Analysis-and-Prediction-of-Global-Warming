ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF GLOBAL WARMING

The project seeks to employ advanced machine learning methodologies to analyze historical climate data, predict future temperature trends, and assess the influence of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Global warming stands as one of the most important challenges of our time, with far-reaching consequences for the environment, ecosystems, and human societies. As the Earth's climate continues to undergo unprecedented changes, there is an urgent need for comprehensive analyses and accurate predictions to guide mitigation efforts. This project endeavors to address this imperative by conducting an in-depth investigation into global warming trends, utilizing three key datasetsâ€”Earth surface temperature, CO2 emissions, and world population data. The integration of advanced machine learning models, including SARIMAX, ARIMAX, VAR, and VECM, enhances our ability to discern intricate patterns and forecast future climate dynamics.
